# HPrArticleQuantityDiscountSlider

## Status

Good idea but the project was never finished. In this project you can see how to add fields to emotion-elements (only PHP
and no ExtJS!).
You can use this code for your own purposes, but you have to change the plugin-namespace for productive usage. 

## Usage

The plugin adds the check-field **Use Quantity** to the product-slider emotion-element. If checked all products with more
than one price (1-x and y-arbitary) will get an buy-button, to put z units of the product to the cart. The quantity z can be
set via a product attribute-field.

## Todos

Create text-snippets to relplace the hardcoded german text in the button-buy.tpl. The button is not using the ajax-cart and
this has to be fixed. A few calculations need more logic.
